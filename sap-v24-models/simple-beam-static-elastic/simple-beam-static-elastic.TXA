 These text files contain the stiffness and mass matrices used for case:
 "POINT"

 File .TXA (this file) describes the rest of the files.
 File .TXE gives the equation number for each DOF at each joint.
 File .TXC defines the constraint equations (only present if needed).
 File .TXK gives the lower half of the symmetric stiffness matrix.
 File .TXM gives the lower half of the symmetric mass matrix.

 Each file includes a single header line that begins with "Note:"
 All data in the files is delimited with the TAB character.

 The number of regular joints         =           3
 The number of internal master joints =           0
 The number of active equations       =           3
 The number of constraint equations   =           0

 Each DOF (U1, U2, U3, R1, R2, R3) at each joint has an equation number as
 given in the .TXE file. Joints include the regular joints that define the
 analysis model, plus internal master joints created to represent the 
 constraints. The equation number may be:

    > 0, from 1 to the number of active equations, indicating the row and
         column in the stiffness and mass matrices of the active equation.
         This corresponds to an Active DOF.

    = 0, indicating a Null or Restrained DOF.

    < 0, from -1 to the (-)number of constraint equations, indicating that the
         value is determined by a constraint equation, see the .TXC file.
         This corresponds to a Constrained DOF.

 Each constraint equation (if any) defines a constrained DOF as a linear
 combination of one or more active DOF. In the .TXC file there is one line of 
 data for each term of each constraint equation. Each line lists the 
 constraint equation number (negative), the active DOF equation number,
 and a coefficient that multiplies the active DOF value. The constrained DOF
 is the sum of these products.
